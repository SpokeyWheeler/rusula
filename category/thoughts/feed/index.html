										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was an interesting meeting held in Split earlier this week. Representatives of the Initiative of the Croatian Associations of People with Disabilities met with Minister Oleg Butković, State Secretary Maja Markovčić Kostelac, President of <a href="https://www.jadrolinija.hr/">Jadrolinija</a> Managing Board David Sopte and Paula Vidović, Director of the Coastal Shipping Agency.<span id="more-602"></span></p>
<p>In order to overcome accessibility issues on ferries and catamarans, a plan was presented by the ministry. There is a need to build new platforms, instead of the foldable slopes which require two crew members to operate. This is the case with the newest ferries to Brac, Kornati, Krk and Mljet.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-608 alignleft" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2018/04/image1-300x169.jpeg" alt="jadrolinija ferry" width="561" height="316" srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2018/04/image1-300x169.jpeg 300w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2018/04/image1-768x432.jpeg 768w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2018/04/image1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2018/04/image1.jpeg 1184w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Catamarans would be supplied with access ramps, which will replace the existing inaccessible &#8220;bridge”.  In this way passengers with disabilities will be provided with an independent entrance over these ramps but it is important to stress that passengers need to submit a notice to the nearest Jadrolinija ticket office in advances.</p>
<p>People with disabilities will be entitled to a free ticket, with a  50% discount for their assisting person. We must keep in mind this is a transitional period and at the end of the year the law will be amended. There will be special cards for People with Disabilities travelling on ferries, catamarans and other maritime transport. It will operate in a similar way to the Jadrolinija Smart Card.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>~Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products~</p></blockquote>
<p>That is the definition but the control of fire by early humans was a turning point in the cultural aspect of human evolution. Fire provided a source of warmth, protection, improvement on hunting and a method for cooking food.<span id="more-587"></span></p>
<p>These cultural advancements allowed for human geographic dispersal, cultural innovations, and changes to diet and behaviour. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Additionally, creating fire allowed the expansion of human activity to proceed into the dark and colder hours of the evening. Earliest definitive evidence of control of fire by a member of Homo range dates from 1.7 to 0.2 million years ago!</span></p>
<h3>Fire represents many things in Dalmatia</h3>
<p>Where is a fire there is a smoke, and where is a smoke there is the smoked meat. A careful process. Where there is a small stone house, there smoke coming out of the chimney and the stone roof tiles. There is a good food, warmth of the home, closenest and hospitality one needs to experience so join us to the glorious ancient fire driven adventure</p>
<p>There is also a fireplace, where old grandma is making some of the most delicious dishes that date back to ancient times. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrians" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ilyrians</a>, Delmats, Greeks, Romans, Croatians, Ottomans&#8230;they all have much in common but one is universal. Authentic gastronomy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Soparnik, Peka, fish stew, bean stew, carefully grilled fish, freshly baked peka bread and its glorious scent! Mmmmmmm delicious</p></blockquote>
<p>Fire has depth in its meaning in our tradition. It inspired the famous Croatian sculptor <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/ivan-mestrovic-1625">Ivan Meštrović</a> who, as a child, lived in inland Dalmatia. He grew up by the fireplace listening to myths and legends which inspired him to create and express his vivid imagination and create something so divine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rusula has been applying creative thinking to make Split accessible for all our guests. Working with local artists and Croatian social enterprises, we want tourism for all to become a reality for the 2018 season. <span id="more-560"></span></p>
<p>We face some unique challenges in our beautiful city, not least a thousand years of history. Although Diocletian retired here, he had a palaceful of servants to ensure that no part of the city of Split was inaccessible. No tripping over uneven pavements for him!</p>
<p>Although private rental accommodation has been working hard to make people welcome, it is often new or refurbished hotels which have the best facilities. Many of their websites offer advice to visitors, but having someone with local knowledge and understanding of your needs can be invaluable.</p>
<p>We have seen some infrastructure improvements in the past few years. There is more ramp access, improved public toilets, and the bronze model of the City on Riva to give context. The new &#8216;tourist palace&#8217; ensures that car rental, excursion and ferry tickets, and restaurants are in one easy to reach place.</p>
<p>The new cruise liner terminal offers easy access to the pedestrian old town. Many accessible tours begin there and step free sightseeing routes around the city have been mapped out. We will do our best to give you the best experience possible.</p>
<p>If you tire of the town it is possible to enjoy the wide smooth paths around the edge of Marjan&#8217;s forest-park. We can also arrange transport to local beaches. Depending on your requirements, we have the sloping sand of Bačvice, or the pebbles of Kašjuni. If a swimming pool complex is more suited to your needs the convenient Jadran is excellent. It has bars, step free access, as well as the sea if you wish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Split has always been a beautiful town. I&#8217;m not just talking about the city and its surrounding area, but our fashion conscious inhabitants. As the days grow longer and the weather settles, we love to dress up in our best clothes and parade up and down the Riva. As the many photographers capture the most striking men and women, every moment is a catwalk opportunity. <span id="more-546"></span></p>
<p>It turns out that this is not a new phenomenon. The stunning exhibition at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Muzej-grada-Splita-110942635645786/">Muzej grada Splita</a> &#8216;From Rococo to Art Nouveau: Clothes and fashion accessories &#8211; a selection from the holdings of the Split City Museum&#8217; opened last night with a burst of colour and flash bulbs. Museum employees delighted us with a parade of period costumes, whilst we waited to see the rarely seen historical textiles, fashion accessories, and associated clothing items.</p>
<p>Many of these priceless items would inspire any modern romantic bride. Delicate lace underwear to make you swoon; a variety of silhouettes to send you to the nearest dress designer; tasselled silk parasols and feathered fans to keep you cool; and colourful waistcoat embroidery to reflect the flowers growing in our natural landscape. And as illustrated, blow kisses to your public with ribbon lace kisses on the back of an ivory silk top.</p>
<p>The imaginative and lively presentation of exhibits highlight the economic, social, and trading importance of the city from the late 17th century. But what seems central is the public gaze. Painters captured the sumptuous fabric of their patrons, and with the invention of photography, we have a continuous history of fashion since the mid-18th century. The people of Split love to admire, and be admired.</p>
<p>Therefore with such a history of dressing up, fashion inspiration, and the skill of our photographers, what better location that Split for the day where you will look your best? Be inspired by our fashion and fall in love all over again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As your symbolic wedding celebrant I ensure everything is perfect for you by working hard behind the scenes. Arranging meetings with photographers, <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshospace-for-possible-dreams/">scouting location</a>s and organsing transport are all essential. But sometimes I get to live the life of a hedonist, and sample the best food and wine that Dalmatia can offer. All for your benefit, of course!<span id="more-540"></span></p>
<p>It was great pleasure to attend one of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/vinousridu/events/?ref=page_internal">Wine is Life</a> events at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pecadofood/">Pecado</a> in Split this week. The chefs there had collaborated with wine experts to come up with a perfectly paired and balanced menu. The aim was to showcase less well-known varieties of local grapes, and highlight some of the smaller local and island producers. So they promised us an island odyssey from Pag to Korčula, with a brief taste of a special Split pošip.</p>
<p>No meal could commence without some tasty fishy canapes; marinated anchovies, smoked local tuna on homemade blinis, which were accompanied by a rare rose from Korčula. I have a special fondness for the Island of Pag so the perfect pairing of a pear scented white with a selection of local cheeses was memorable. Pag is renowned for its cheeses, and the salty fresh clean air, makes something special of the wine.</p>
<p>The first main course arrived with a fillet of seabass on a broccoli squid ink paste, This set off the colouful julienned vegetables beautifully. But the bone dry <em>grk</em>, again from Korčula was a refreshing balance to the food. We were informed about the ancient history of wine making on the islands, which is reflected in the name &#8211; <em>grk</em> &#8211; greek. The meat course was paired with a gutsy metalic white from Vis. It seemed to work well with the tasty ribs, sweet beetroot, and thrice cooked potatoes.</p>
<p>The &#8216;best til last&#8217; adage was preserved when we saw what was coming for dessert. True indulgence with a bitter chocolate ganache with apricot jelly, and accompanied with the only red of the meal. A <a href="http://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=2142370">2009 barrique plavac mali </a>from Tomić Vinery on Hvar. It was something to savour and appreciate, and we lingered over it.</p>
<p>This is just the briefest of notes of an extraordinary tasting menu. Ask me for more details and we can make your wedding dinner as special as this.</p>

<p>As a symbolic wedding celebrant, I offer my couples the chance to create a unique ceremony. You can choose your own readings, poems, vows, or incorporate your own cultural rituals into the event. For instance I&#8217;ve recently been researching glass breaking at weddings. But for me no wedding ceremony is complete without music.</p>
<p>My city of Split is alive with sound. From day rehearsals in the music school, to lunchtime recitals in the theatre.  In the evening the cafes invite live bands to play so you can dance on Roman Peristil. Hot music is pumped out of our late night colourful nightclubs. No visit to the Palace is complete without the sound of traditional klapa echoing around the ancient architecture. Or you can stand and listen to the old songs wheezed out by the elderly gentleman on Marmontova.</p>
<p>Music is everywhere. It is in our hearts.</p>
<p>A major part of the ceremony atmosphere is music, and as the bridal couple, you will come with your favourite soundtracks of life. We all do. Therefore if you let me know what you like &#8211; voice, acoustic, jazz, classical, traditional, folk &#8211; I can  provide the perfect music to complement your wedding. Gifted musicians &#8211; yet another reason to come to Croatia for your wedding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love this time of year when the light is changing and everything springs into life. After a winter where Dalmatia has unusually seen some January snow,  we have enjoyed our hot spiced wine, and convivial evenings in our cosy homes. But we are now looking ahead to the new season.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had sunny days, and like all Dalmatians, I&#8217;ve made the most of them. Not just enjoying excellent coffee on our elegant Riva, but taking quiet ferries to deserted islands, bus trips to menu tastings in remote village restaurants, investigating natural underground wonders. I&#8217;m constantly being inspired by places to hold symbolic weddings.</p>
<p>It is my role to listen to your ideas, and then make them happen.  Ideas are bursting out of my notebook and I can&#8217;t wait to show you all the venues that I&#8217;ve found this winter!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to do when romance is all around me. The blossom falls like confetti from my cherry tree. Softly cooing collared doves in my garden watch me as I prepare scripts for fast approaching weddings. And having just purchased a number of beautiful candle holders to light up your festivities, I&#8217;m ready for the joy of your happy days.</p>
<p>Bring out the light. Bring out the sunshine!</p>
