										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Split has always been a beautiful town. I&#8217;m not just talking about the city and its surrounding area, but our fashion conscious inhabitants. As the days grow longer and the weather settles, we love to dress up in our best clothes and parade up and down the Riva. As the many photographers capture the most striking men and women, every moment is a catwalk opportunity. <span id="more-546"></span></p>
<p>It turns out that this is not a new phenomenon. The stunning exhibition at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Muzej-grada-Splita-110942635645786/">Muzej grada Splita</a> &#8216;From Rococo to Art Nouveau: Clothes and fashion accessories &#8211; a selection from the holdings of the Split City Museum&#8217; opened last night with a burst of colour and flash bulbs. Museum employees delighted us with a parade of period costumes, whilst we waited to see the rarely seen historical textiles, fashion accessories, and associated clothing items.</p>
<p>Many of these priceless items would inspire any modern romantic bride. Delicate lace underwear to make you swoon; a variety of silhouettes to send you to the nearest dress designer; tasselled silk parasols and feathered fans to keep you cool; and colourful waistcoat embroidery to reflect the flowers growing in our natural landscape. And as illustrated, blow kisses to your public with ribbon lace kisses on the back of an ivory silk top.</p>
<p>The imaginative and lively presentation of exhibits highlight the economic, social, and trading importance of the city from the late 17th century. But what seems central is the public gaze. Painters captured the sumptuous fabric of their patrons, and with the invention of photography, we have a continuous history of fashion since the mid-18th century. The people of Split love to admire, and be admired.</p>
<p>Therefore with such a history of dressing up, fashion inspiration, and the skill of our photographers, what better location that Split for the day where you will look your best? Be inspired by our fashion and fall in love all over again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is nothing like an evening meander through an ancient village; watch out for the little wine shop and a rough flight of stairs to your right. Head up there through people&#8217;s gardens, and keep climbing. You&#8217;ll eventually see a brown sign pointing to a viewpoint and the church of <a href="https://www.google.hr/maps/uv?hl=en&#038;pb=!1s0x134b8d00e85bdc8d:0x6c8d16eaaa167b71!2m19!2m2!1i80!2i80!3m1!2i20!16m13!1b1!2m2!1m1!1e1!2m2!1m1!1e3!2m2!1m1!1e5!2m2!1m1!1e4!3m1!7e115!4shttps://picasaweb.google.com/lh/sredir?uname%3D107739697715330223295%26id%3D6311592422646852706%26target%3DPHOTO!5strojstvo+-+Google+Search&#038;imagekey=!1e3!2s-YZ-umzgVChg/V5dH3j7prGI/AAAAAAACU_g/49-7Ece5zLk_r4McSSrYkfwQfo901naDQCLIB&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwis46TDhb3TAhVJORQKHRUMB_gQoioImAEwEA"><em>Sv. Trojstvo</em></a> (Holy Trinity). Look out for the rocky path underfoot, but keep an eye on the view behind you as you rise above the trees.<span id="more-526"></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll finally reach the tiny stone church and a view of the island that will leave you gasping for what&#8217;s left of your breath. This isn&#8217;t the highest point on the island of Šipan, but it certainly competes for the most accessible and most beautiful. The fields are far below, but listen and you can hear a pheasant warn that the day is coming to a close. Sitting on the precipitous wall, I was watching the sun go down spectacularly over Mljet, beyond even the majestic Pelješac Peninsular, and down into the Adriatic Sea.</p>
<p>The silent evidence of the passage of time left me considering who else had observed this everyday phenomenon. The abbess&#8217;s grave with its lichen encrusted cross gives a clue. Fragments of Renaissance latin text is carved into stone and built into later developments. You can touch the history here, tracing the letters with your fingers. Being a curious type I later asked a local for more information about this place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing special or interesting&#8221;, she replied.</p>
<p>From the 16th century onwards a community of nuns used to take care of the islanders. They didn&#8217;t just do this in the usual pastoral or religious sense, but they acted as the early warning system for when pirates used to carry out regular raids along the coast. From their vantage point, they could see the other churches below, the Benedictines on the Island of Sv Andrija (5 miles away), as well as the towers of Sipanska Luka&#8217;s Rectors Palace. In this way they would communicate with everyone, and news would spread.</p>
<p>For those of a romantic disposition, and lover of historical fiction, imagine richly embroidered stories of castaway pirates and young novitiates. Or read about the legend of undying love between a woman from Lopud and a wealthy aristocrat from Dubrovnik, who gave her up to become a monk on Sv Andrija. In a place like this, watching the sun go down, your mind is filled with possible dreams, and living romance. And it is most certainly special and interesting.</p>
