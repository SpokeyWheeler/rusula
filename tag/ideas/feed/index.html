										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Split has always been a beautiful town. I&#8217;m not just talking about the city and its surrounding area, but our fashion conscious inhabitants. As the days grow longer and the weather settles, we love to dress up in our best clothes and parade up and down the Riva. As the many photographers capture the most striking men and women, every moment is a catwalk opportunity. <span id="more-546"></span></p>
<p>It turns out that this is not a new phenomenon. The stunning exhibition at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Muzej-grada-Splita-110942635645786/">Muzej grada Splita</a> &#8216;From Rococo to Art Nouveau: Clothes and fashion accessories &#8211; a selection from the holdings of the Split City Museum&#8217; opened last night with a burst of colour and flash bulbs. Museum employees delighted us with a parade of period costumes, whilst we waited to see the rarely seen historical textiles, fashion accessories, and associated clothing items.</p>
<p>Many of these priceless items would inspire any modern romantic bride. Delicate lace underwear to make you swoon; a variety of silhouettes to send you to the nearest dress designer; tasselled silk parasols and feathered fans to keep you cool; and colourful waistcoat embroidery to reflect the flowers growing in our natural landscape. And as illustrated, blow kisses to your public with ribbon lace kisses on the back of an ivory silk top.</p>
<p>The imaginative and lively presentation of exhibits highlight the economic, social, and trading importance of the city from the late 17th century. But what seems central is the public gaze. Painters captured the sumptuous fabric of their patrons, and with the invention of photography, we have a continuous history of fashion since the mid-18th century. The people of Split love to admire, and be admired.</p>
<p>Therefore with such a history of dressing up, fashion inspiration, and the skill of our photographers, what better location that Split for the day where you will look your best? Be inspired by our fashion and fall in love all over again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As your symbolic wedding celebrant I ensure everything is perfect for you by working hard behind the scenes. Arranging meetings with photographers, <a href="https://rusula.onrender.com/space-for-possible-dreams/">scouting location</a>s and organsing transport are all essential. But sometimes I get to live the life of a hedonist, and sample the best food and wine that Dalmatia can offer. All for your benefit, of course!<span id="more-540"></span></p>
<p>It was great pleasure to attend one of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/vinousridu/events/?ref=page_internal">Wine is Life</a> events at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pecadofood/">Pecado</a> in Split this week. The chefs there had collaborated with wine experts to come up with a perfectly paired and balanced menu. The aim was to showcase less well-known varieties of local grapes, and highlight some of the smaller local and island producers. So they promised us an island odyssey from Pag to Korčula, with a brief taste of a special Split pošip.</p>
<p>No meal could commence without some tasty fishy canapes; marinated anchovies, smoked local tuna on homemade blinis, which were accompanied by a rare rose from Korčula. I have a special fondness for the Island of Pag so the perfect pairing of a pear scented white with a selection of local cheeses was memorable. Pag is renowned for its cheeses, and the salty fresh clean air, makes something special of the wine.</p>
<p>The first main course arrived with a fillet of seabass on a broccoli squid ink paste, This set off the colouful julienned vegetables beautifully. But the bone dry <em>grk</em>, again from Korčula was a refreshing balance to the food. We were informed about the ancient history of wine making on the islands, which is reflected in the name &#8211; <em>grk</em> &#8211; greek. The meat course was paired with a gutsy metalic white from Vis. It seemed to work well with the tasty ribs, sweet beetroot, and thrice cooked potatoes.</p>
<p>The &#8216;best til last&#8217; adage was preserved when we saw what was coming for dessert. True indulgence with a bitter chocolate ganache with apricot jelly, and accompanied with the only red of the meal. A <a href="http://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=2142370">2009 barrique plavac mali </a>from Tomić Vinery on Hvar. It was something to savour and appreciate, and we lingered over it.</p>
<p>This is just the briefest of notes of an extraordinary tasting menu. Ask me for more details and we can make your wedding dinner as special as this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those people who long to connect with history and a sense of place, the city of Split is perfect. However some people yearn to escape to rural island bliss. Part of the essence of the symbolic wedding, is the expression of a partnership in a different, more meaningful way. It can be individually crafted to your needs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently exploring a remote island an hour and half away from the pearl of the Adriatic &#8211; Dubrovnik. There is more to be said about both this island AND the city of Dubrovnik, but that is to follow. I&#8217;ve been inspired by the wildflowers which currently litter the unspoilt country paths and natural beach side foliage. Like tiny jewels, they could adorn any bridal outfit.</p>
<p>Despite the recent cold bura wind, all the evergreen shrubs, olive and bay trees are shining with new growth. The lavender bushes are waking up and stretching in the April sunshine. They will soon be reaching towards the blue sky, looking forward to the June scent harvest. The soothing and homely scent of the purple and grey flower, is a popular floral request at my weddings.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m imagining adding hedgerow colours; vibrant pinks from herb robert, rockrose, and mallow bindweek. Sapphire periwinkles and blue pimpernels to match the sky and sea. Then yellows of buttercup and horseshoe vetch. And to match the sunlight twinkling off the water, add tiny white wild garlic flowers, and a sprinkle of daisies. There are greens of all shades, from pale grasses to golden sunspurge.</p>
<p>Unlike cut cultivated flowers like my favourite, the rose, or <em>rusula</em>,  these delicate blooms may not make it through the day. But why not pay homage to some of our wild flowers in your all-natural arrangements. And embrace a romantic view of nature, to become the ultimate flower child!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love this time of year when the light is changing and everything springs into life. After a winter where Dalmatia has unusually seen some January snow,  we have enjoyed our hot spiced wine, and convivial evenings in our cosy homes. But we are now looking ahead to the new season.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had sunny days, and like all Dalmatians, I&#8217;ve made the most of them. Not just enjoying excellent coffee on our elegant Riva, but taking quiet ferries to deserted islands, bus trips to menu tastings in remote village restaurants, investigating natural underground wonders. I&#8217;m constantly being inspired by places to hold symbolic weddings.</p>
<p>It is my role to listen to your ideas, and then make them happen.  Ideas are bursting out of my notebook and I can&#8217;t wait to show you all the venues that I&#8217;ve found this winter!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to do when romance is all around me. The blossom falls like confetti from my cherry tree. Softly cooing collared doves in my garden watch me as I prepare scripts for fast approaching weddings. And having just purchased a number of beautiful candle holders to light up your festivities, I&#8217;m ready for the joy of your happy days.</p>
<p>Bring out the light. Bring out the sunshine!</p>
