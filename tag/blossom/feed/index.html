										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love this time of year when the light is changing and everything springs into life. After a winter where Dalmatia has unusually seen some January snow,  we have enjoyed our hot spiced wine, and convivial evenings in our cosy homes. But we are now looking ahead to the new season.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had sunny days, and like all Dalmatians, I&#8217;ve made the most of them. Not just enjoying excellent coffee on our elegant Riva, but taking quiet ferries to deserted islands, bus trips to menu tastings in remote village restaurants, investigating natural underground wonders. I&#8217;m constantly being inspired by places to hold symbolic weddings.</p>
<p>It is my role to listen to your ideas, and then make them happen.  Ideas are bursting out of my notebook and I can&#8217;t wait to show you all the venues that I&#8217;ve found this winter!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to do when romance is all around me. The blossom falls like confetti from my cherry tree. Softly cooing collared doves in my garden watch me as I prepare scripts for fast approaching weddings. And having just purchased a number of beautiful candle holders to light up your festivities, I&#8217;m ready for the joy of your happy days.</p>
<p>Bring out the light. Bring out the sunshine!</p>
