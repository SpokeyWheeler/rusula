										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rusula has been applying creative thinking to make Split accessible for all our guests. Working with local artists and Croatian social enterprises, we want tourism for all to become a reality for the 2018 season. <span id="more-560"></span></p>
<p>We face some unique challenges in our beautiful city, not least a thousand years of history. Although Diocletian retired here, he had a palaceful of servants to ensure that no part of the city of Split was inaccessible. No tripping over uneven pavements for him!</p>
<p>Although private rental accommodation has been working hard to make people welcome, it is often new or refurbished hotels which have the best facilities. Many of their websites offer advice to visitors, but having someone with local knowledge and understanding of your needs can be invaluable.</p>
<p>We have seen some infrastructure improvements in the past few years. There is more ramp access, improved public toilets, and the bronze model of the City on Riva to give context. The new &#8216;tourist palace&#8217; ensures that car rental, excursion and ferry tickets, and restaurants are in one easy to reach place.</p>
<p>The new cruise liner terminal offers easy access to the pedestrian old town. Many accessible tours begin there and step free sightseeing routes around the city have been mapped out. We will do our best to give you the best experience possible.</p>
<p>If you tire of the town it is possible to enjoy the wide smooth paths around the edge of Marjan&#8217;s forest-park. We can also arrange transport to local beaches. Depending on your requirements, we have the sloping sand of Bačvice, or the pebbles of Kašjuni. If a swimming pool complex is more suited to your needs the convenient Jadran is excellent. It has bars, step free access, as well as the sea if you wish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Split has always been a beautiful town. I&#8217;m not just talking about the city and its surrounding area, but our fashion conscious inhabitants. As the days grow longer and the weather settles, we love to dress up in our best clothes and parade up and down the Riva. As the many photographers capture the most striking men and women, every moment is a catwalk opportunity. <span id="more-546"></span></p>
<p>It turns out that this is not a new phenomenon. The stunning exhibition at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Muzej-grada-Splita-110942635645786/">Muzej grada Splita</a> &#8216;From Rococo to Art Nouveau: Clothes and fashion accessories &#8211; a selection from the holdings of the Split City Museum&#8217; opened last night with a burst of colour and flash bulbs. Museum employees delighted us with a parade of period costumes, whilst we waited to see the rarely seen historical textiles, fashion accessories, and associated clothing items.</p>
<p>Many of these priceless items would inspire any modern romantic bride. Delicate lace underwear to make you swoon; a variety of silhouettes to send you to the nearest dress designer; tasselled silk parasols and feathered fans to keep you cool; and colourful waistcoat embroidery to reflect the flowers growing in our natural landscape. And as illustrated, blow kisses to your public with ribbon lace kisses on the back of an ivory silk top.</p>
<p>The imaginative and lively presentation of exhibits highlight the economic, social, and trading importance of the city from the late 17th century. But what seems central is the public gaze. Painters captured the sumptuous fabric of their patrons, and with the invention of photography, we have a continuous history of fashion since the mid-18th century. The people of Split love to admire, and be admired.</p>
<p>Therefore with such a history of dressing up, fashion inspiration, and the skill of our photographers, what better location that Split for the day where you will look your best? Be inspired by our fashion and fall in love all over again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As your symbolic wedding celebrant I ensure everything is perfect for you by working hard behind the scenes. Arranging meetings with photographers, <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshospace-for-possible-dreams/">scouting location</a>s and organsing transport are all essential. But sometimes I get to live the life of a hedonist, and sample the best food and wine that Dalmatia can offer. All for your benefit, of course!<span id="more-540"></span></p>
<p>It was great pleasure to attend one of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/vinousridu/events/?ref=page_internal">Wine is Life</a> events at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pecadofood/">Pecado</a> in Split this week. The chefs there had collaborated with wine experts to come up with a perfectly paired and balanced menu. The aim was to showcase less well-known varieties of local grapes, and highlight some of the smaller local and island producers. So they promised us an island odyssey from Pag to Korčula, with a brief taste of a special Split pošip.</p>
<p>No meal could commence without some tasty fishy canapes; marinated anchovies, smoked local tuna on homemade blinis, which were accompanied by a rare rose from Korčula. I have a special fondness for the Island of Pag so the perfect pairing of a pear scented white with a selection of local cheeses was memorable. Pag is renowned for its cheeses, and the salty fresh clean air, makes something special of the wine.</p>
<p>The first main course arrived with a fillet of seabass on a broccoli squid ink paste, This set off the colouful julienned vegetables beautifully. But the bone dry <em>grk</em>, again from Korčula was a refreshing balance to the food. We were informed about the ancient history of wine making on the islands, which is reflected in the name &#8211; <em>grk</em> &#8211; greek. The meat course was paired with a gutsy metalic white from Vis. It seemed to work well with the tasty ribs, sweet beetroot, and thrice cooked potatoes.</p>
<p>The &#8216;best til last&#8217; adage was preserved when we saw what was coming for dessert. True indulgence with a bitter chocolate ganache with apricot jelly, and accompanied with the only red of the meal. A <a href="http://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=2142370">2009 barrique plavac mali </a>from Tomić Vinery on Hvar. It was something to savour and appreciate, and we lingered over it.</p>
<p>This is just the briefest of notes of an extraordinary tasting menu. Ask me for more details and we can make your wedding dinner as special as this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those people who long to connect with history and a sense of place, the city of Split is perfect. However some people yearn to escape to rural island bliss. Part of the essence of the symbolic wedding, is the expression of a partnership in a different, more meaningful way. It can be individually crafted to your needs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently exploring a remote island an hour and half away from the pearl of the Adriatic &#8211; Dubrovnik. There is more to be said about both this island AND the city of Dubrovnik, but that is to follow. I&#8217;ve been inspired by the wildflowers which currently litter the unspoilt country paths and natural beach side foliage. Like tiny jewels, they could adorn any bridal outfit.</p>
<p>Despite the recent cold bura wind, all the evergreen shrubs, olive and bay trees are shining with new growth. The lavender bushes are waking up and stretching in the April sunshine. They will soon be reaching towards the blue sky, looking forward to the June scent harvest. The soothing and homely scent of the purple and grey flower, is a popular floral request at my weddings.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m imagining adding hedgerow colours; vibrant pinks from herb robert, rockrose, and mallow bindweek. Sapphire periwinkles and blue pimpernels to match the sky and sea. Then yellows of buttercup and horseshoe vetch. And to match the sunlight twinkling off the water, add tiny white wild garlic flowers, and a sprinkle of daisies. There are greens of all shades, from pale grasses to golden sunspurge.</p>
<p>Unlike cut cultivated flowers like my favourite, the rose, or <em>rusula</em>,  these delicate blooms may not make it through the day. But why not pay homage to some of our wild flowers in your all-natural arrangements. And embrace a romantic view of nature, to become the ultimate flower child!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Easter marks a change in atmosphere here, as it is a time of new awakenings. The City is celebrating the end of Lent and the associated religious festivals.  The communal <a href="https://www.dalmacijadanas.hr/proslavite-uskrs-uz-okuse-i-mirise-dalmacije/">Easter breakfast on Prokurativ</a>e is a recent addition to our Easter tradition, and eating together is always a joyous experience.</p>
<p>But whilst the church calendar turns from dark to light, so does our world of hospitality. The Easter market on Riva gives an atmosphere of business and colour, with an inviting scent of frying <em>fritule</em> (mini doughnuts). We are busy getting everything tidy, and ready to welcome our Summer guests to our beautiful city.</p>
<p>Everyone in Varoš is rushing around with damp laundry, new cleaning materials, or even opening restaurants which haven&#8217;t been seen since late last year. It&#8217;s good to see familiar faces and catch up during a brief <em>pauza </em>whilst walking up the hill.</p>
<p>As I add the finishing touches to my little house, I stand back and appreciate the effect anew, just as a guest might. The sun shines in through the glistening windows, the comforting smell of lavender and vanilla permeates through the space, and the golden wood glows with happiness. And the trip to <a href="http://www.visitsplit.com/en/517/pazar">Pazar </a>for flowers was well worth the bicycle ride this morning.</p>
<p>Perfection. You are all welcome.</p>
