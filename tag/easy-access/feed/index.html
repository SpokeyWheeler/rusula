										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was an interesting meeting held in Split earlier this week. Representatives of the Initiative of the Croatian Associations of People with Disabilities met with Minister Oleg Butković, State Secretary Maja Markovčić Kostelac, President of <a href="https://www.jadrolinija.hr/">Jadrolinija</a> Managing Board David Sopte and Paula Vidović, Director of the Coastal Shipping Agency.<span id="more-602"></span></p>
<p>In order to overcome accessibility issues on ferries and catamarans, a plan was presented by the ministry. There is a need to build new platforms, instead of the foldable slopes which require two crew members to operate. This is the case with the newest ferries to Brac, Kornati, Krk and Mljet.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-608 alignleft" src="https://rusula.onrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image1-300x169.jpeg" alt="jadrolinija ferry" width="561" height="316" srcset="https://rusula.onrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://rusula.onrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://rusula.onrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://rusula.onrender.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image1.jpeg 1184w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Catamarans would be supplied with access ramps, which will replace the existing inaccessible &#8220;bridge”.  In this way passengers with disabilities will be provided with an independent entrance over these ramps but it is important to stress that passengers need to submit a notice to the nearest Jadrolinija ticket office in advances.</p>
<p>People with disabilities will be entitled to a free ticket, with a  50% discount for their assisting person. We must keep in mind this is a transitional period and at the end of the year the law will be amended. There will be special cards for People with Disabilities travelling on ferries, catamarans and other maritime transport. It will operate in a similar way to the Jadrolinija Smart Card.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rusula has been applying creative thinking to make Split accessible for all our guests. Working with local artists and Croatian social enterprises, we want tourism for all to become a reality for the 2018 season. <span id="more-560"></span></p>
<p>We face some unique challenges in our beautiful city, not least a thousand years of history. Although Diocletian retired here, he had a palaceful of servants to ensure that no part of the city of Split was inaccessible. No tripping over uneven pavements for him!</p>
<p>Although private rental accommodation has been working hard to make people welcome, it is often new or refurbished hotels which have the best facilities. Many of their websites offer advice to visitors, but having someone with local knowledge and understanding of your needs can be invaluable.</p>
<p>We have seen some infrastructure improvements in the past few years. There is more ramp access, improved public toilets, and the bronze model of the City on Riva to give context. The new &#8216;tourist palace&#8217; ensures that car rental, excursion and ferry tickets, and restaurants are in one easy to reach place.</p>
<p>The new cruise liner terminal offers easy access to the pedestrian old town. Many accessible tours begin there and step free sightseeing routes around the city have been mapped out. We will do our best to give you the best experience possible.</p>
<p>If you tire of the town it is possible to enjoy the wide smooth paths around the edge of Marjan&#8217;s forest-park. We can also arrange transport to local beaches. Depending on your requirements, we have the sloping sand of Bačvice, or the pebbles of Kašjuni. If a swimming pool complex is more suited to your needs the convenient Jadran is excellent. It has bars, step free access, as well as the sea if you wish.</p>
