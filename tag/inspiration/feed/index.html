										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Split has always been a beautiful town. I&#8217;m not just talking about the city and its surrounding area, but our fashion conscious inhabitants. As the days grow longer and the weather settles, we love to dress up in our best clothes and parade up and down the Riva. As the many photographers capture the most striking men and women, every moment is a catwalk opportunity. <span id="more-546"></span></p>
<p>It turns out that this is not a new phenomenon. The stunning exhibition at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Muzej-grada-Splita-110942635645786/">Muzej grada Splita</a> &#8216;From Rococo to Art Nouveau: Clothes and fashion accessories &#8211; a selection from the holdings of the Split City Museum&#8217; opened last night with a burst of colour and flash bulbs. Museum employees delighted us with a parade of period costumes, whilst we waited to see the rarely seen historical textiles, fashion accessories, and associated clothing items.</p>
<p>Many of these priceless items would inspire any modern romantic bride. Delicate lace underwear to make you swoon; a variety of silhouettes to send you to the nearest dress designer; tasselled silk parasols and feathered fans to keep you cool; and colourful waistcoat embroidery to reflect the flowers growing in our natural landscape. And as illustrated, blow kisses to your public with ribbon lace kisses on the back of an ivory silk top.</p>
<p>The imaginative and lively presentation of exhibits highlight the economic, social, and trading importance of the city from the late 17th century. But what seems central is the public gaze. Painters captured the sumptuous fabric of their patrons, and with the invention of photography, we have a continuous history of fashion since the mid-18th century. The people of Split love to admire, and be admired.</p>
<p>Therefore with such a history of dressing up, fashion inspiration, and the skill of our photographers, what better location that Split for the day where you will look your best? Be inspired by our fashion and fall in love all over again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those people who long to connect with history and a sense of place, the city of Split is perfect. However some people yearn to escape to rural island bliss. Part of the essence of the symbolic wedding, is the expression of a partnership in a different, more meaningful way. It can be individually crafted to your needs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently exploring a remote island an hour and half away from the pearl of the Adriatic &#8211; Dubrovnik. There is more to be said about both this island AND the city of Dubrovnik, but that is to follow. I&#8217;ve been inspired by the wildflowers which currently litter the unspoilt country paths and natural beach side foliage. Like tiny jewels, they could adorn any bridal outfit.</p>
<p>Despite the recent cold bura wind, all the evergreen shrubs, olive and bay trees are shining with new growth. The lavender bushes are waking up and stretching in the April sunshine. They will soon be reaching towards the blue sky, looking forward to the June scent harvest. The soothing and homely scent of the purple and grey flower, is a popular floral request at my weddings.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m imagining adding hedgerow colours; vibrant pinks from herb robert, rockrose, and mallow bindweek. Sapphire periwinkles and blue pimpernels to match the sky and sea. Then yellows of buttercup and horseshoe vetch. And to match the sunlight twinkling off the water, add tiny white wild garlic flowers, and a sprinkle of daisies. There are greens of all shades, from pale grasses to golden sunspurge.</p>
<p>Unlike cut cultivated flowers like my favourite, the rose, or <em>rusula</em>,  these delicate blooms may not make it through the day. But why not pay homage to some of our wild flowers in your all-natural arrangements. And embrace a romantic view of nature, to become the ultimate flower child!</p>
