<p>That is the definition but the control of fire by early humans was a turning point in the cultural aspect of human evolution. Fire provided a source of warmth, protection, improvement on hunting and a method for cooking food.<span id="more-587"></span></p>
<p>These cultural advancements allowed for human geographic dispersal, cultural innovations, and changes to diet and behaviour. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Additionally, creating fire allowed the expansion of human activity to proceed into the dark and colder hours of the evening. Earliest definitive evidence of control of fire by a member of Homo range dates from 1.7 to 0.2 million years ago!</span></p>
<h3>Fire represents many things in Dalmatia</h3>
<p>Where is a fire there is a smoke, and where is a smoke there is the smoked meat. A careful process. Where there is a small stone house, there smoke coming out of the chimney and the stone roof tiles. There is a good food, warmth of the home, closenest and hospitality one needs to experience so join us to the glorious ancient fire driven adventure</p>
<p>There is also a fireplace, where old grandma is making some of the most delicious dishes that date back to ancient times. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrians" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ilyrians</a>, Delmats, Greeks, Romans, Croatians, Ottomans&#8230;they all have much in common but one is universal. Authentic gastronomy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Soparnik, Peka, fish stew, bean stew, carefully grilled fish, freshly baked peka bread and its glorious scent! Mmmmmmm delicious</p></blockquote>
<p>Fire has depth in its meaning in our tradition. It inspired the famous Croatian sculptor <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/ivan-mestrovic-1625">Ivan Meštrović</a> who, as a child, lived in inland Dalmatia. He grew up by the fireplace listening to myths and legends which inspired him to create and express his vivid imagination and create something so divine.</p>
