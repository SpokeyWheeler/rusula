<p>That is the definition but the control of fire by early humans was a turning point in the cultural aspect of human evolution. Fire provided a source of warmth, protection, improvement on hunting and a method for cooking food.<span id="more-587"></span></p>
<p>These cultural advancements allowed for human geographic dispersal, cultural innovations, and changes to diet and behaviour. <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Additionally, creating fire allowed the expansion of human activity to proceed into the dark and colder hours of the evening. Earliest definitive evidence of control of fire by a member of Homo range dates from 1.7 to 0.2 million years ago!</span></p>
<h3>Fire represents many things in Dalmatia</h3>
<p>Where is a fire there is a smoke, and where is a smoke there is the smoked meat. A careful process. Where there is a small stone house, there smoke coming out of the chimney and the stone roof tiles. There is a good food, warmth of the home, closenest and hospitality one needs to experience so join us to the glorious ancient fire driven adventure</p>
<p>There is also a fireplace, where old grandma is making some of the most delicious dishes that date back to ancient times. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrians" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ilyrians</a>, Delmats, Greeks, Romans, Croatians, Ottomans&#8230;they all have much in common but one is universal. Authentic gastronomy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Soparnik, Peka, fish stew, bean stew, carefully grilled fish, freshly baked peka bread and its glorious scent! Mmmmmmm delicious</p></blockquote>
<p>Fire has depth in its meaning in our tradition. It inspired the famous Croatian sculptor <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/ivan-mestrovic-1625">Ivan Meštrović</a> who, as a child, lived in inland Dalmatia. He grew up by the fireplace listening to myths and legends which inspired him to create and express his vivid imagination and create something so divine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As your symbolic wedding celebrant I ensure everything is perfect for you by working hard behind the scenes. Arranging meetings with photographers, <a href="https://rusula.onrender.com/space-for-possible-dreams/">scouting location</a>s and organsing transport are all essential. But sometimes I get to live the life of a hedonist, and sample the best food and wine that Dalmatia can offer. All for your benefit, of course!<span id="more-540"></span></p>
<p>It was great pleasure to attend one of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/vinousridu/events/?ref=page_internal">Wine is Life</a> events at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pecadofood/">Pecado</a> in Split this week. The chefs there had collaborated with wine experts to come up with a perfectly paired and balanced menu. The aim was to showcase less well-known varieties of local grapes, and highlight some of the smaller local and island producers. So they promised us an island odyssey from Pag to Korčula, with a brief taste of a special Split pošip.</p>
<p>No meal could commence without some tasty fishy canapes; marinated anchovies, smoked local tuna on homemade blinis, which were accompanied by a rare rose from Korčula. I have a special fondness for the Island of Pag so the perfect pairing of a pear scented white with a selection of local cheeses was memorable. Pag is renowned for its cheeses, and the salty fresh clean air, makes something special of the wine.</p>
<p>The first main course arrived with a fillet of seabass on a broccoli squid ink paste, This set off the colouful julienned vegetables beautifully. But the bone dry <em>grk</em>, again from Korčula was a refreshing balance to the food. We were informed about the ancient history of wine making on the islands, which is reflected in the name &#8211; <em>grk</em> &#8211; greek. The meat course was paired with a gutsy metalic white from Vis. It seemed to work well with the tasty ribs, sweet beetroot, and thrice cooked potatoes.</p>
<p>The &#8216;best til last&#8217; adage was preserved when we saw what was coming for dessert. True indulgence with a bitter chocolate ganache with apricot jelly, and accompanied with the only red of the meal. A <a href="http://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=2142370">2009 barrique plavac mali </a>from Tomić Vinery on Hvar. It was something to savour and appreciate, and we lingered over it.</p>
<p>This is just the briefest of notes of an extraordinary tasting menu. Ask me for more details and we can make your wedding dinner as special as this.</p>
